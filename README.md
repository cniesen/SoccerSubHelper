Create substitution list for U6/U8 soccer games

Substituions are fixed at 5 minute intervals.  The focus is given to equal playtime over the whole season.

Even being incomplete, it works and is being used. ;)


Modules:
--------

* cli:    Command line interface that utelizes the engine to build substitution list.  
          For usage instructions run the program without arguments. 
      
* engine: The engine that builds the substitution list.  Unfortunately there is no cool AI in it. 
          Just hard coded logic that makes an OK substitution list.
